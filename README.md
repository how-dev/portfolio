# Full-Stack Developer

Hi! I am a full-stack developer specializing in React, Typescript, Python, SQL and SQLAlchemy!

## `About me:`

Since I was a child I have always been passionate about programming and technology. My father works in computing and has always taught me programming logic since I was a little boy. At 10 years old I already programmed games in RPG Maker VX / XP. In my teens, I worked with friends on online games inspired by Habbo Hotel, which used Flash, from Adobe, and C #. In adulthood, when I entered the Faculty of Engineering, I had contact with Python, and soon with JavaScript. I'm 21 years old, super excited and eager to learn. Passionate about projects and jobs that involve leadership and a very strong sense of entrepreneurship. I always seek to innovate and improve. Excellent communication and critical thinking. Studying & coding is what I love to do the most in my life.
